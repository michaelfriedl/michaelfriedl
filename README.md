# Here I am
Having had parents working in the computer industries gave me some early pivileges I wasn't aware they were by then. My father had stacks of funny looking yellow card strips in the top drawer of his desk, held together by red rubber bands around them.
Naw, don't touch them, junior. When they get mixed up, they become useless. When I was around 14, I was allowed to use an IBM text processor, a huge, whirring and wizzing thing with a monochromatic amber screen, a fixed keyboard with beefy keys, sloppy 8" floppy disks which could store as much as some hundred text documents. Mainly letters. Dear madam/sir... 
The printer was __the__ shit, folks. 24 needles, zigzag folded paper having tracks with round holes on each side. A page only took a minute. _Graphic content_ then was a scattergramm showings monthly sales where '*'s, '#' and '+'. A friend of mine owned a Sinclair ZX81. We spent hours on writing *Basic* programs, telling silly little jokes, interactivly, for sure! Pressing the wrong key resulted in different levels of insults. That was fun. Then came the Atari 1040STM. Cost me a fortune, built in keyboard, 3 1/2" disc drive, BW screen (Hi-Res, mind you: 640x400px), mouse and - no, that was it. Software was unaffordable by then, thus I resorted to shareware, the floppies were 2-3$ each. Amazing what we could squeeze into 1,44MB. Motorola's 68000 assembly language was the first I learned  and I was bewildered when I bought my first "IBM-compatible", 386SX, grabbed a copy of the assembly language reference manual for it and found out that they had the operators swapped! Let alone the funny registers AX, BX, CX, DX. AH what? Took me a while to getting used to it. Why assembler? Well, my Dad gave me a copy of the Phoenix Bios Terminal Handbook. Interrupts... exiting. I wrote programs which popped up after pressing some acrobatic key chords telling me the time.
My first real payed job was creating a dBase III database (I started experimenting with dBase II, taking inventory of my mom's storeroom) for a company wiring up domestic communication systems. Door intercomms, that is. Without knowing it, I created netlists. Later in chemical industries, I used dBase V to build a hierarchical components list of a detergents plant. dBase V had SQL in it, so I got slowly but steadily sucked into the world of databases.
Today I am a fullstack developer, building 'fat clients' in c#, using WPF and WCF (yes, still, but we transite most applications to Azure Service bus), mostly for SQL server backends.
Being lazy by nature, employ a wide range of tools to save me tedious work. Among there are:-
<ul>
  <li>Regex, my all time swiss army knive</li>
  <li>Powershell</li>
  <li>bash</li>
  <li>javascript</li>
  <li>html</li>
  <li>css</li>
  <li>xml</li>
  <li>gawk</li>
  <li>sed</li>
  <li>vba<p>
    Most people think of vba  as to 'record a macro, fiddle with it until it gives me a deprecation table'.
    Does creating linked lists, hashtables, custom collation and quick sort sound like an MS Word template?
    You bet, it does. You will find such weirdness in my public repositories soon.

  </ul>

Since around 1985 I have been working mainly for chemical and pharmaceutical industries, covering a wide range of projects.
